<h1>Machine Learning Operations (MLOps) Notes</h1>
<b>Prepared by Vytautas Bielinskas.</b>

<h2>The MLOps Lifecycle</h2>
<p><li>
  <ul><b>ML development</b> concerns experimenting and developing a robust and reproducible model training procedure (training pipeline code), which consists of multiple tasks from data preparation and transformation to model training and evaluation.</ul>
  <ul><b>Training operationalization</b> concerns automating thre process of packaging, testing, and deploying repeatable and reliable training pipelines.</ul>
  <ul><b>Continuous training</b> concerns repeatedly executing the training pipeline in response to the new data or to code changes, or on a schedule, potentially with new training settings.</ul>
  <ul><b>Model deployment</b> concerns packaging, testing, and deploying a model to a serving environment for online experimentation and production serving.</ul>
  <ul><b>Prediction serving</b> is about serving the model that is deployed in production for inference.</ul>
  <ul><b>Continuous monitoring</b> is about monitoring the effectiveness and efficiency of a deployed model.</ul>
  <ul><b>Data and model management</b> is a central, cross-cutting functon for governing ML artifacts to support audit-ability, traceability, and compliance. Data and model management can also promote shareability, resuability, and discoverability of ML assets</ul>
