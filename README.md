<h1>Machine Learning Operations (MLOps) Notes</h1>
<b>Prepared by Vytautas Bielinskas.</b>

<h2>The MLOps Lifecycle</h2>
<p><ul>
  <li><b>ML development</b> concerns experimenting and developing a robust and reproducible model training procedure (training pipeline code), which consists of multiple tasks from data preparation and transformation to model training and evaluation.</li>
  <li><b>Training operationalization</b> concerns automating thre process of packaging, testing, and deploying repeatable and reliable training pipelines.</li>
  <li><b>Continuous training</b> concerns repeatedly executing the training pipeline in response to the new data or to code changes, or on a schedule, potentially with new training settings.</li>
  <li><b>Model deployment</b> concerns packaging, testing, and deploying a model to a serving environment for online experimentation and production serving.</li>
  <li><b>Prediction serving</b> is about serving the model that is deployed in production for inference.</li>
  <li><b>Continuous monitoring</b> is about monitoring the effectiveness and efficiency of a deployed model.</li>
  <li><b>Data and model management</b> is a central, cross-cutting functon for governing ML artifacts to support audit-ability, traceability, and compliance. Data and model management can also promote shareability, resuability, and discoverability of ML assets</li>
  </ul></p>
  
<h2>MLOps Workflow</h2>
<p>The MLOps Workflow is segmented into two modules:
<ul>
  <li><b>MLOps pipelines</b> (build, deploy, and monitoring) - the upper layer.
  <li><b>Build</b> pipeline: Data ingestion, Model training, Model testing, Model packaging, Model registering.</li>
  </li>
  <li><b>Drivers</b>: Data, code, artifacts, middleware, and infrastructure - mid and lower layers.</li>
</ul>  
  </p>
